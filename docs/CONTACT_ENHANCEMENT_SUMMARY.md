## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects file in ContactPage
2. Frontend validates file type and size
3. Form submission uses FormData for file upload
4. Backend validates and stores file in storage/contact-attachments
5. File path and original name stored in database
6. Email notification includes attachment if present

### Pre-filling Flow
1. User clicks "Konfirmasi Donasi" button on DonationPage
2. Navigation to ContactPage with state containing pre-filled data
3. ContactPage detects state and pre-fills subject/message
4. If user is authenticated, fetches user data from /api/user endpoint
5. Auto-fills name and email from user account
6. UI shows badges and notifications for auto-filled data

### Validation Rules
```php
// Backend validation (ContactController.php)
'name' => 'required|string|max:100',
'email' => 'required|email|max:100',
'subject' => 'required|string|max:150',
'message' => 'required|string|max:2000',
'attachment' => 'nullable|file|mimes:jpeg,jpg,png,pdf,doc,docx|max:10240'
```
