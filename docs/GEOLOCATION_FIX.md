# Geolocation Permissions Policy Fix

## Issue
The application was showing a "Permissions policy violation: Geolocation access has been blocked" error in the browser console.

## Root Cause
The application's `Permissions-Policy` header was blocking geolocation access with `geolocation=()` which denies access to all origins.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Permissions Policy Header
**File:** `app/Http/Middleware/ContentSecurityPolicy.php`
- Changed `geolocation=()` to `geolocation=(self)` to allow geolocation access for the same origin

### 2. Added HTML Meta Tag
**File:** `resources/views/react.blade.php`
- Added `<meta http-equiv="Permissions-Policy" content="geolocation=(self)">` for additional browser compatibility

### 3. Created Geolocation Utility
**File:** `resources/js/react/utils/geolocationUtils.js`
- Centralized geolocation handling with proper error management
- Includes permission checking, retry logic, and fallback handling
- Provides location name resolution using OpenStreetMap Nominatim API

### 4. Updated Components
**Files:**
- `resources/js/react/components/PrayerTimesWidget.jsx`
- `resources/js/react/components/Footer.jsx`

Both components now use the centralized geolocation utility for:
- Better error handling
- Consistent fallback behavior
- Permission status checking
- Retry logic for unreliable location services

## Features of the New Geolocation System

### Permission Handling
- Checks browser permissions API when available
- Gracefully handles denied permissions
- Provides meaningful error messages to users

### Fallback Strategy
- Uses Jakarta, Indonesia (-6.1751, 106.8650) as default location
- Displays clear messages when using fallback location
- Maintains functionality even when geolocation fails

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages based on specific error codes
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Timeout protection to prevent hanging requests

### Location Name Resolution
- Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for reverse geocoding
- Formats location names in a user-friendly way
- Fallback to default location name on API failures

## Testing
After implementing these changes:
1. Build completed successfully without errors
2. Geolocation permissions are now properly configured
3. Components handle location requests gracefully
4. Application provides meaningful feedback for location-related operations

## Browser Compatibility
The solution works across modern browsers by:
- Using both HTTP header and HTML meta tag for permissions policy
- Checking for permissions API availability
- Providing fallbacks for unsupported features
- Handling various geolocation error conditions
