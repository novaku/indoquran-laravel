## How It Works

1. User submits registration form via React frontend
2. `RegisterController@register` method processes the registration
3. User account is created in the database
4. Email notification is sent to `kontak@indoquran.web.id`
5. Response is returned to the frontend

## Email Content

The notification email includes:
- ✅ User's full name
- ✅ User's email address
- ✅ User ID
- ✅ Registration timestamp
- ✅ Total user count statistics
- ✅ Professional IndoQuran branding

## Error Handling

- Email sending is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Registration process continues even if email fails
- All events are logged for monitoring
- No user-facing errors for email failures

## Testing

The system has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Email notifications are sent successfully
- ✅ Registration process works correctly

- ✅ Error handling works as expected

## Monitoring

Check Laravel logs for email-related events:
